The main function that people might be interested in here is fit_local_models. Here, the local model refers to one that has already been rotated to correspond to the 3 eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor. This function takes data with the same form as fit_DT (https://github.com/vigente/gerardus/blob/master/matlab/DiffusionMRIToolbox/fit_DT.m), fits a diffusion tensor, rotates the b-matrix, and then fits various models. These models include the stretched exponential, bi-exponential, diffusion kurtosis, gamma distribution, beta distribution, and truncated Gaussian distribution models.
