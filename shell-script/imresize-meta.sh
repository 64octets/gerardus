# imresize-meta.sh
#
# Resize one or more 2D images, taking care of also changing the pixel
# spacing accordingly so that the real world print size remains the
# same.
#
# Original images are not overwritten. Instead, the resized copy is
# saved to a directory chosen by the user.
#
# Syntax:
#
# ./imresize-meta.sh [-o outdir] [-s scale] file1 [file2...]
#
# Options:
#
#   -o outdir: (def /tmp) Output directory to save resized images to
#
#   -s scale:  (def 5) Resizing factor in %. E.g. -s 10 means resize
#              images to 10% of original size.
#
#   file1 [file2...] List of image files to be resized (e.g. PNG, TIF...).
