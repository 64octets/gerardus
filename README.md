About
=============================================================================================================

Gerardus is an ecclectic collection of Matlab toolboxes, bash scripts and C++ programs produced as a result
of research carried out by post docs and students who collaborate with Prof. Vicente Grau at the Institute of
Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford, UK.

Our research is focused primarily on medical imaging and computational biology.

Historical note: Gerardus Mercator (1512â€“1594) was a Flemish cartographer, and the first to use the word 
"atlas" to describe a collection of maps.

Download and build
=============================================================================================================

The latest version of the code can be pulled from the master branch of this GitHub repository.

Gerardus contains Matlab functions that can be run directly without building any code. There are also C++ programs and C++ MEX files that need to be compiled and installed before they can be run.

If you need the programs and/or MEX files, follow the [instructions to build and install Gerardus](https://github.com/rcasero/gerardus/wiki/Build-instructions).

See the most updated list of all available functions:

* [Matlab functions](matlab/README)
* [shell scripts](shell-script/README)
* [java code](java/README)
* [C++/ITK command line programs](cpp/README)
