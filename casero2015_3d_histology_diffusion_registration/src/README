Overview
===========================================================================

In this "src/" directory we provide the Matlab scripts and
dependencies that we used for the experiments, figures and results in
this paper.

In the "src/hand_tracing/" directory we provide landmarks and masks
that we traced by hand, so that readers can reproduce our results. The
data (blockface and histology images) are not provided in this
directory, but in the location stated in the paper.

A list of all main scripts and their purpose can be found below. We
ran the scripts on Matlab 8.3.0.532 (R2014a).

The scripts are not meant to be invoked by name and run fully, as they
contain debug code, code to hand trace landmarks and masks,
etc. Instead, the user should run individual sections understanding
what each part is doing.

Note also that variables that point to the location of the data will
need to be edited to suit the local configuration of each user.

Summary of scripts in the src/ directory
===========================================================================

* 'histology_blockface_mouse.m'

% Script to reconstruct one half of Mouse Q53 heart's low-res histology,
% using blockface as external reference, and detail of Left Ventricle (LV)
% free wall.
%
%   - Correct alignment of blockface stack.
%   - Pre-process blockface images.
%   - Rigid alignment of low-res histology to blockface.
%   - Rigid diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology.
%   - B-spline diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology.
%     (4 registration sweeps, 5 neighbor updates each).
%   - B-spline diffusion refinement of hi-res intra-histology, 
%     detail of LV free wall (4 registration sweeps, 
%     100 neighbor updates each).

* 'histology_noblockface_mouse.m'

% Script to reconstruct one half of Mouse Q53 heart's low-res histology,
% without an external reference, to compare to
% "histology_blockface_mouse.m".
%
%   - Sequential pre-alignment of low-res histology.
%   - Rigid diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology.
%   - B-spline diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology 
%     (4 registration sweeps, 5 neighbor updates each).

* 'histology_refinement_only_diffusion.m'

% Script to replace the low-res B-spline refinement in
% "histology_blockface_mouse.m":
%
%   - B-spline diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology.
%     (1 registration sweeps, 1, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 neighbor updates).

* 'histology_refinement_without_diffusion.m'

% Script to replace the low-res B-spline refinement in
% "histology_blockface_mouse.m":
%
%   - B-spline diffusion refinement of low-res intra-histology.
%     (20 registration sweeps, no neighbor updates).

* 'manual_landmarks.m'

% Script to hand trace landmarks in pairs of
%   - blockface / histology slices
%   - histology / histology slices
% to validate the reconstruction algorithms.

* 'toy_examples.m'

% Obsolete, not used in final paper.

* 'validate_reconstruction.m'

% This is a validation script. We assume:
%
%   * a low-res histology reconstruction has been computed with
%     histology_blockface_mouse.m, histology_refinement_without_diffusion.m
%     or a similar script.
%
%   * manual landmarks between blockface/histology and histology/histology
%     slices have been traced using script manual_landmarks.m.
%
% Then, this script will apply the reconstruction transforms to the
% landmarks, and compute how far they are from each other at each
% refinement step.
%
% All the user has to do is choose below which transforms are going to be
% validated.
%
% This script can be reused to validate, e.g.
%   * a naive algorithm without diffusion
%   * our diffusion reconstruction
%   * an algorithm with only 1 registration sweep and a lot of diffusion
%   * ...
%
% Validation of the "diffusion only" experiment is in another script
% (validate_reconstruction_onlydiff.m).

* 'validate_reconstruction_noblockface.m'

% This is a validation script. We assume that
%
%   * a histology reconstruction has been computed with
%     histology_noblockface_mouse.m
%
%   * manual landmarks between histology/histology
%     slices have been traced using script manual_landmarks.m.
%
% Then, this script will apply the reconstruction transforms to the
% landmarks, and compute how far they are from each other at each
% refinement step.
%
% Note that we are validating the reconstruction without blockface, but we
% still need the blockface landmarks so that we can measure how much the
% reconstruction differs from the true anatomy.

* 'validate_reconstruction_onlydiff.m'

% Similar script to validate_reconstruction.m, but this one is for the
% "diffusion only" experiment, because instead of having a single vector of
% transforms, we have a cell vector with the transforms for each level of
% diffusion.

* 'paper_figures.m'

% Script to generate the plots/figures used in the paper using the
% images and validation data generated with the scripts above.
