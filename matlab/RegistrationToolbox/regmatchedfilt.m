function [tElx, cmax, imm] = regmatchedfilt(imf, imm)
% REGMATCHEDFILT  Matched filter registration.
%
% REGMATCHEDFILT uses a matched filter approach to find a global optimum
% for the translation registration of two images.
%
% Assuming white noise, if we have signal s(t) with duration T, its matched
% filter is h(t)=s(T-t). If we convolve s(t)*h(t), the convolution has a
% peak at t=T, when both signals best overlap. We apply this idea to image
% registration, with the fixed image as s(t) and the moving image as h(t).
% This function uses FFTs to implement the convolution.
%
% An alternative is phase correlation registration (imregcorr). Phase
% correlation is similar to a matched filter, but normalizes the magnitude
% of the transforms in Fourier space. This may work better or worse than
% the matched filter, depending on the characteristics of the images.
%
% TELX = REGMATCHEDFILT(IMF, IMM)
%
%   IMF, IMM are two grayscale images, not necessarily of the same size.
%   IMF is the fixed image, and IMM is the moving image.
%
%   TELX is the transform in Elastix format that register IMM onto IMF.
%
% [TELX, CMAX, IMMREG] = REGMATCHEDFILT(...)
%
%   CMAX is a scalar with the value of the convolution peak.
%
%   IMMREG is the image resulting from applying the translation transform
%   to IMM.
