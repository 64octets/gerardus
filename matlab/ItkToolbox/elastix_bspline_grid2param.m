function v = elastix_bspline_grid2param(varargin)
% ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID2PARAM  Convert control points from grid to
% TransformParameters vector form.
%
% V = ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID2PARAM(GX, GY)
%
%   GX, GY are matrices describing a grid of B-spline control points
%   coordinates or displacements. This is a similar format to the output of
%   NDGRID. They follow the Matlab convention that X->columns and Y->rows.
%
%   Important: Function elastix_bspline_grid produces control point
%   coordinates, not displacements. So if you apply
%   ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID2PARAM to the output of elastix_bspline_grid, you
%   will get a vector of coordinates, not of displacements. Note that
%   elastix uses displacements in TransformParameters. To obtain the
%   displacements, see example below.
%
%   V is a vector with all the values in GX and GY formatted for an elastix
%   TransformParameters transform field.
%
% V = ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID2PARAM(GX, GY, ..., GN)
% 
%   Syntax for N-dimensional grids.
%
% Example:
%
%   % assume we have a B-spline transform t
%
%   % coordinates of displaced control points
%   [gx, gy] = elastix_bspline_grid(t);
%
%   % coordinates of control points without displacement
%   t0 = t;
%   t0.TransformParameters(:) = 0;
%   [gx0, gy0] = elastix_bspline_grid(t0);
%
%   % convert the displacements back from grid to vector format
%   v = elastix_bspline_grid2param(gx - gx0, gy - gy0);
%
%   % check that we have recovered the original transform parameters vector
%   % (an output of 0 means no error)
%   any(abs(v - t.TransformParameters) > 1e-12)
