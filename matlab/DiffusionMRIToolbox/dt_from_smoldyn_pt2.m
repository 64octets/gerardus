%DT_FROM_SMOLDYN_PT2 Calculates the MRI signal
%
% PART 2 OF THE CALCULATION OF THE DIFFUSION TENSOR FROM THE SMOLDYN MODEL DATA
% This part calculates the diffusion MRI signal from the positions data.
% Note that providing each set of positions data contains the same number
% of molecules, the MRI signal from different sets of positions data can be
% combined by just taking the mean.
%
% Inputs are:
%   positions: matrix of size no of molecules x 3 x no of timesteps generated
%       from the Smoldyn program and cut down in part 1
%   voxel_size: scalar. the total (isotropic) size of the volume simulated (um)
%   step_time: scalar. the time of each step as used to generate the Smoldyn diffusion (us)
%   delta: scalar. the gradient pulse time (us)
%   Delta: scalar. the time between gradient pulses (us)
%   gradient_directions: matrix of size no of directions x 3 which gives
%       the x,y,z components of the gradient directions
%   gradient_strength: IF UNKNOWN, SET TO 0 & IT WILL BE CALCULATED FROM
%       BVALUE. scalar. (T/um)
%   bvalue: IF UNKNOWN, SET TO 0 & IT WILL BE CALCULATED FROM
%       GRADIENT_STRENGTH. scalar. (um^2/us)
%
% Outputs are:
%   MRI_signal: relative signal for each of the gradient directions
%   bvalue: as input, included as an output as needed later
