function [ positions, voxel_size, step_time, delta, Delta ] = dt_from_smoldyn_pt1( positions, voxel_size, actual_voxel_size, step_time, delta, Delta )
%DT_FROM_SMOLDYN_PT1 Cuts down the positions data to only that needed.
%
% PART 1 OF THE CALCULATION OF THE DIFFUSION TENSOR FROM THE SMOLDYN MODEL DATA
% This part cuts down the positions data to the actual voxel size, and to
% the echo time (TE), i.e. removes data not needed. Only those molecules
% within the voxel at the echo time contribute to the signal measured in
% that molecule. In addition, cutting down the data at this stage allows several
% positions files to be loaded and analysed in one go without reaching the
% memory capacity of Matlab and/or making the process too slow.
%
% Inputs are
%   positions: file of size no of molecules x 3 x no of timesteps generated
%       from the Smoldyn program and converted to matlab format
%   voxel_size: the total (isotropic) size of the volume simulated (um)
%   actual_voxel_size: the (isotropic) size of the voxel to be analysed, at
%       the centre of the total volume (um)
%   step_time: the time of each step as used to generate the Smoldyn diffusion (us)
%   delta: the gradient pulse time (us)
%   Delta: the time between gradient pulses (us)
%   If the data has already been cut down to the required voxel size, then
%   input actual voxel size and voxel size as the same number
%
%  Outputs are
%   positions: file of size no of molecules x 3 x no of timesteps with now
%       only those molecules that finish in the voxel included.
%   voxel_size: as input, included as an output as needed later
%   step_time: as input, included as an output as needed later
%   delta: as input, included as an output as needed later
%   Delta: as input, included as an output as needed later
