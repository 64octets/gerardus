function [ x ] = tensor2vector( T, scale )
% TENSOR2VECTOR converts a tensor from 3x3 or 6x6 format to 6x1 or 15x1
% format respectively.
% The scale parameter tells you whether to account for the fact that
% certain elements are repeated - you might use this if you want to
% multiply tensors together
