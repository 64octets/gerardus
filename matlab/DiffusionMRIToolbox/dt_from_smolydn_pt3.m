function [ DT, FA, ADC, eVal, eVect, angle ] = DT_from_Smolydn_pt3( MRI_signal, gradient_directions, bvalue )
%DT_FROM_SMOLDYN_PT3 Calculates DT from MRI signal
%  
% PART 3 OF THE CALCULATION OF THE DIFFUSION TENSOR FROM THE SMOLDYN MODEL DATA
% This part calculates the diffusion tensor from the MRI signals.
%
% Inputs are:
%   MRI_signal: vector of no of directions, as calculated in part 2.
%   gradient_directions: matrix of size no of directions x 3 which gives
%       the x,y,z components of the gradient directions
%   bvalue: scalar. (um^2/us)
%
% Outputs are:
%   DT: diffusion tensor
%   FA: fractional anisotropy
%   ADC: apparant diffusion coefficient
%   eVal: eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor
%   eVect: eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor
%   angle: angle of primary eigenvector with the x? direction.
