function c = imcmass(im)
% IMCMASS  Centre of mass of an image.
%
% IMCMASS computes the centre of mass of a grayscale image weighting the
% pixel coordinates by the pixel intensities.
%
% C = IMCMASS(IM)
%
%   IM is a grayscale 2D image.
%
%   C is the center of mass of the image in [row, col] format.
