function [intensities1, intensities2,intersectCoords] =  scimat_lineintersection(scimat1, scimat2, coords1, coords2, res)

% SCIMAT_LINEINTERSECTION Returns the line intensities from two
% intersecting scimat files at a specified resolution. 


%   This function operated on a Slice - by - Slice method: 
%   Scimat1.data and Scimat2.data are 2D datasets 
%   However the data is in 3D space.
%   The user has the choice to specify the Slice and Frame wanted. 
%
%   Function SCIMAT_LINEINTERSECTION() takes two scimat structures
%   along with their coordinates and a specified line resolution. It
%   proceeds to calculate the line of intersection and interpolates the
%   line intensities for both slices. It then returns the line
%   intensities as the outputs. 
%
%   [INTENSITIES1,INTENSITIES2] = SCIMAT_LINEINTERSECTION(SCIMAT1,SCIMAT2,COORDS1,COORDS2,RES)
%       
%   INTENSITIES1,INTENSITIES2 are both the outputs. They are the
%   interpolated line intensities derived from the line between the two 
%   intersecting planes.
%   
%   SCIMAT1,SCIMAT2 (inputs) are both scimat structs
%   
%   COORDS1,COORDS2 (inputs) are the respective cartesian coordinates for
%   scimat1 and scimat2
% 
%   RES is the resolution of the line intensity. It is in mm. A resolution
%   of 1, (RES = 1) accounts for the spacing resolution found in the scimat
%   struct (scimat.axis.spacing). i.e: RES = 1 is equal to a sample point
%   on the line at every 0.0015mm.

% slice's orthogonal vector % A1 = The first's slice's first corner % A2 =
% The second's slice's first corner % % OUTPUTS: % % P = Point at the
% intersection of the two slices.

% Defaults: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
P=[0 0 0]; % Initiate point in 3D space
% Point on first plane (take the first corner voxel accross time frames)
PP1 = S1corner1; % Data is 4D (x,y,z accross time)
% Point on second plane (take the first corner voxel accross time frames)
PP2 = S2corner1; % Data is 4D (x,y,z accross time)
% The orthogonal plane vectors are already known:
% S1norm = Orthogonal vector of first planes throughout time (4D) 
% S2norm = Orthogonal vector of second plane throughout time (4D)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Get the angle between the plane and a point on that line. 
      
d1 = -dot(S1norm,PP1);   %the constants in the Plane 1 equations
d2 = -dot(S2norm, PP2);  %the constants in the Plane 2 equations

% First step is to determine max abs coordinate of cross product
% This allows us to know wether line intersects plane with x = 0,y = 0, or z = 0;
% Next step is to get a point on the intersection line 
% Zero the max coord, and solve for the other two
% There exists three cases which can exists for which the vector containing
% the direction of the line can cross a plane : either the line intersects 
% with x = 0, or y = 0, or z = 0.  The output P gives a point at the
% intersection of the two slices. 

        maxc=find(abs(LineDir)== max(abs(LineDir)));
        
        switch maxc(1)
            case 1                   % intersect with x=0
                P(1)= 0;
                P(2) = (d2*S1norm(3) - d1*S2norm(3))/ LineDir(1);
                P(3) = (d1*S2norm(2) - d2*S1norm(2))/ LineDir(1);
            case 2                    %intersect with y=0

                P(3) = 0;
        end

% P is now a 4D vector containing the x,y,z coordinates for a point on the
% line of intersection between scimat1 and scimat2 across all slices and frames. 

%% Third Step: Calculate coordinates on the intersection lines
% Now we have the direction of the line intersecting both plane, and a
% point on that line. Thus the equation becomes : 
% r =(P(1),P(2),P(3)))+T*(Direction_of_line(1),Direction_of_line(2),Direction_of_line(3))
% Where T in the 'spacing' or 'resolution' of the line (i.e if we want the
% line to be between a discreet interval or to go on infinitely)
% Since the line we get is infinite, we also want to calculate the end points to the line.
% This will be achieved by calculating the points at which the line
% interscect with the sides of the planes (i.e: the vector between their
% corners)


% Defaults: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% the longest distance within the image volume is the length of the largest
% diagonal. We compute it in voxel units:
% That is the maximum amount of voxels that can lie on the line. 
lmax = ceil(sqrt(sum(([scimat1.axis.size] - 1).^2))); 
T = 0; % Initiate Resolution; 
% Res = 0.3; % Resolution
lmax = lmax/Res;
lmax = ceil(lmax); % Needed if resolution is greater then 1;
% Preallocate a vector containing the maximum possible amount of points lying
% plane. 
Pmaxp = zeros(lmax,3); % A lmax-by-3 vector to be allocated x, y z coordsflat of line points for NEGATIVE/POSITIVE direction

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% To avoid for loop, we put everything in vector form:

% Vectorize T:
T = repmat((-(lmax-1):Res:lmax-1)',[1,3]);

% Create a matrix of P and LineDir:

P = repmat(P,size(T,1),1);
LineDir = repmat(LineDir,size(T,1),1);

% Calculate line equations:
Pmaxp = P+(T.*(LineDir));
