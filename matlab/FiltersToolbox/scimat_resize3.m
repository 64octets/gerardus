function scimat2 = scimat_resize3(scimat, sz, sigma)
% SCIMAT_RESIZE3 Resize a 3D scimat image.
%
% This function requires the Gerardus binary resize3DImage, built into
% directory "programs" by the Gerardus CMake build system. The binary has
% to be in the path too, which can be done running script
% add_gerardus_paths.m.
%
% Note that the function writes the scimat struct to a temp file for
% resize3DImage. If you have the image already in a file format that ITK
% can read (e.g. .mha), it will be faster to run resize3DImage directly on
% the file, rather than using this Matlab interface.
%
% SCIMAT2 = SCIMAT_RESIZE3(SCIMAT, SZ, SIGMA)
%
%   SCIMAT, SCIMAT2 are the input and output scimat structs that contain
%   the image to be resized (see "help scimat" for details).
%
%   SZ is a 3-vector with the size of the output SCIMAT2 in [row col slice]
%   order.
%
%   SIGMA is a 3-vector with the standard deviation (in pixel units, [row
%   col slice] order) of the Gaussian low-pass filter used for
%   anti-aliasing. The more decimation, the larger SIGMA should be to avoid
%   aliasing artifacts. On the other hand, too much blurring will degrade
%   the result unnecessarily. By default, SIGMA = size(SCIMAT.data) ./
%   size(SCIMAT2.data), but often it's better to have less blurring.
