function tElx = elastix_fitgeotrans(movingPoints, fixedPoints, transform, sz, spacing, origin, alpha)
% ELASTIX_FITGEOTRANS  Transformix struct for image transformation obtained
% from matching two sets of landmarks
%
% The goal of this function is to create a Transformix struct to deform an
% image. The transform maps a set of landmarks on the image to another set
% of landmarks.
%
% TELX = ELASTIX_FITGEOTRANS(MOVINGPOINTS, FIXEDPOINTS, TRANSFORM, SZ, SPACING, ORIGIN)
%
%   TELX is a struct that can be passed to transformix() to deform an
%   image.
%
%   MOVINGPOINTS, FIXEDPOINTS are matrices of the same size, with the
%   coordinates of the target (fixed) and source (moving) landmarks,
%   respectively. Each row contains the coordinates of a point.
%
%   We use Matlab's fitgeotrans() function to find a transformation from
%   the moving to the fixed points. We then invert the transformation
%   matrix, because image transformation goes in the opposite direction as
%   point transformation. Finally, we create the Transformix struct.
%
%   TRANSFORM is a string with the transformation that matches the two sets
%   of landmarks. Currently, we have only implemented 'affine', but it's
%   very easy to add a couple of lines to this function for other
%   transformations supported by Matlab's fitgeotrans ("help fitgeotrans"
%   for options).
%
%   SZ = [cols, rows] is a vector with the size of the output image that
%   transformix will create. Note the Elastix order is different from
%   Matlab's order of size vectors.
%
%   SPACING = [dx, dy] is a vector with the pixel size of the output image.
%
%   ORIGIN = [offx, offy] is a vector with the coordinates of the first
%   pixel in the output image.
%
% TELX = ELASTIX_FITGEOTRANS(..., ALPHA)
%
%   ALPHA is a scalar in [0.0, 1.0]. ALPHA=1.0 (default) means that the
%   full deformation corresponding to the map MOVINGPOINTS->FIXEDPOINTS is
%   applied to the image. ALPHA=0.0 means no deformation is applied.
%   Intermediate values represent intermediate deformations. If the full
%   affine transformation is given by the matrix A, then the transformation
%   applied is (Alexa 2002)
%
%   B = expm(ALPHA*logm(A))
%
%   Note that Alexa's method may produce transformations that are complex.
%   In that case, the function returns an error.
%
%   This parameter allows, e.g. that both images "meet in the middle".
%   Suppose that by mapping the landmarks X -> Y we can align image IM1 to
%   IM2. With ALPHA=0.5, we can deform IM1 halfway towards IM2, and IM2
%   halfway towards IM1.
