function varargin = elastix_cat(varargin)
% ELASTIX_CAT  Concatenation of elastix transforms.
%
% Elastix allows for a list of transforms to be applied to an image. For
% example, if we have a translation transform
%
%   T1 = 
% 
%                              Transform: 'TranslationTransform'
%                     NumberOfParameters: 1
%                    TransformParameters: [1x2 double]
%    InitialTransformParametersFileName:  [1x1 struct]
%                 HowToCombineTransforms: 'Compose'
%
% we can see that "InitialTransformParametersFileName" points to another
% transform, and "HowToCombineTransforms" specifies that they will be
% composed. The second transform could be, for example, a B-spline
%
%   T1.InitialTransformParametersFileName = 
% 
%                              Transform: 'BSplineTransform'
%                     NumberOfParameters: 84
%                    TransformParameters: [1x84 double]
%     InitialTransformParametersFileName: 'NoInitialTransform'
%
% This second transform does not point any further transforms (although it
% could, having a longer list). In this example, the translation is applied
% first to the image, and then the B-spline.
%
% Note: It's a bit confusing that "InitialTransformParametersFileName"
% points to the transform that is going to be applied to the image after
% the current one. However, this makes sense because when we register A to
% B in elastix, the transform returned is for coordinates from B to A. The
% reason for this is that otherwise transforming an image could leave
% "holes" after resampling.
%
% ELASTIX_CAT allows to concatenate a list of elastix transforms, each of
% which can be a simple transform or a list of transforms.
%
% TOUT = ELASTIX_CAT(T1, ..., TN)
%
%   T1, ..., TN is a list of N elastix transforms, each being a struct.
%   Each transform can be simple, or be a concatenation of transforms using
%   the InitialTransformParametersFileName field.
%
%   TOUT is a struct with T1, ..., TN concatenated such that T1 is applied
%   first to the image, then T2, etc, until TN.
