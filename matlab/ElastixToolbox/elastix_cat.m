% ELASTIX_CAT  Concatenation of elastix transforms.
%
% ELASTIX_CAT allows to concatenate a list of elastix transforms, each of
% which can be a simple transform or a list of transforms.
%
% Elastix allows for a list of transforms to be applied to an image. For
% example, if we want to apply a translation transform followed by a
% B-spline transform, we can use
%
%   TF = 
% 
%                              Transform: 'BSplineTransform'
%                     NumberOfParameters: 84
%                    TransformParameters: [1x84 double]
%     InitialTransformParametersFileName: [1x1 struct]
%                 HowToCombineTransforms: 'Compose'
%
%   with
%
%   TF.InitialTransformParametersFileName = 
% 
%                              Transform: 'TranslationTransform'
%                     NumberOfParameters: 1
%                    TransformParameters: [1x2 double]
%    InitialTransformParametersFileName:  'NoInitialTransform'
%
%
% TFOUT = ELASTIX_CAT(TF1, ..., TFN)
%
%   TF1, ..., TFN is a list of N elastix transforms, each being a struct,
%   that we want to apply to the image in that order. Each transform can be
%   simple, or be a concatenation of transforms using the
%   InitialTransformParametersFileName field.
%
%   Note: Counterintuitively, if you have a moving image IMM0, and apply a
%   transform T0 to obtain IMM, and then register it to a fixed image IMF,
%   to concatenate T1 and T0, T1 has to be the initial transform, so that
%   T0.InitialTransformParametersFileName=T1.
%
%        T1 = elastix(REGPARAM, IMF, IMM);
%        TTOT1 = elastix_cat(T1, T0);       
%
%   The reason is that elastix transforms map coordinates from fixed to
%   moving space. However, if instead of applying T0 explicitly you provide
%   it with parameter -t0, then the result will already have the
%   concatenation in the more intuitive order
%   TTOT2.InitialTransformParametersFileName=T0, and no explicit
%   concatenation is necessary
%
%        OPT.t0 = T0;
%        TTOT2 = elastix(REGPARAM, IMF, IMM0, OPT);
%
%
%   TF1(1:M), ..., TFN(1:M) can also be vectors of transforms, as long as
%   all of them have the same number of elements. In that case, the
%   concatenation is applied separately to each TF1(I), ..., TFN(I).
%
%   TFOUT is a struct with TF1, ..., TFN concatenated:
%
%   TFOUT = TFN
%           TFN.InitialTransformParametersFileName = TF(N-1)
%               TF(N-1).InitialTransformParametersFileName = TF(N-2)
%                   ...
%                    TF1.InitialTransformParametersFileName = 'NoInitialTransform'
