function tElx = elastix_affine_crot(tElx, c2)
% ELASTIX_AFFINE_CROT  Change centre of rotation of Elastix affine
% transform.
%
% TOUT = ELASTIX_AFFINE_CROT(T, C)
%
%   This function changes the centre of rotation of affine transform T to
%   vector C, producing TOUT. Both T and TOUT produce the same transform on
%   an image. By default, C=0.
