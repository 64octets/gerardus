% ELASTIX_COMPOSE_AFFTRANSF  Composition of two 2D affine transforms.
%
% ELASTIX_COMPOSE_AFFTRANSF composes two 2D transforms from the affine
% family, and produces another affine transform.
%
% TFC = ELASTIX_COMPOSE_AFFTRANSF(TF1, TF2)
%
%   TF1, TF2 are two affine transforms to be applied in that order to an
%   _image_ (not to point coordinates). E.g. TF1 is a translation
%   transform, and TF2 is a rigid transform.
%
%   IMPORTANT: In elastix,
%
%       TF2.InitialTransformParametersFileName = TF1
%
%   means that TF1 is the initial transform, followed by TF2. However, if
%   you want to manually apply the transforms to the image, you have to do
%   in the inverse order to obtain the same result (except for accumulated
%   interpolation errors):
%
%       IM2 = transformix(TF2, IM);
%       IM3 = transformix(TF1, IM2);
%
%   TF1, TF2 can have the following formats:
%
%   * (3, 3)-matrices with the Matlab tform convention (help affine2d and
%     projective2d for details) to map coordinates in homogeneous
%     coordinates with the rotation centered on the origin of coordinates
%     (0, 0):
%
%     [y 1] = [x 1] * [A 0]
%                     [t 1]
%
%     Note that for rigid transformations, A = [ cos(theta)  sin(theta)]
%                                              [-sin(theta)  cos(theta)]
%
%   * struct format produced by elastix (see help elastix for details):
%
%     'AffineTransform'
%     'SimilarityTransform'
%     'EulerTransform' (= Rigid transform)
%     'TranslationTransform'
%
%     which can be centered anywhere else. Note that if TF1 or TF2 point to
%     any subsequent transforms with TF.InitialTransformParametersFileName,
%     they will be ignored.
%
%   TFC is the composed transform. TFC is a matrix or struct depending on
%   whether TFC1 is a matrix or struct, and it has the same centre of
%   rotation as TF1. If TF1 is a struct, then TFC is given as the most
%   flexible of the two types in TF1, TF2. For example, if TF1 is
%   an EulerTransform and TF2 is a SimilarityTransform, TFC will be
%   a SimilarityTransform.
%
%   TFC has the same output size as TF2, which is logical, because TF2 is
%   the last transform to be applied to the image. However, we keep the
%   center of rotation of TF1.
