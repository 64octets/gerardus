function varargout = elastix_bspline_grid(t)
% ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID  Control point grid of B-spline transformation.
%
% [GX, GY] = ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID(T)
%
%   T is a struct with the 2D B-spline transform parameters, or a string
%   with the path to a file with the transforms.
%
%   GX, GY are matrices with the coordinates of the B-spline coefficients.
%   This is a similar format to the output of NDGRID. They follow the
%   Matlab convention that X->columns and Y->rows. Note that Elastix
%   parameters follow the convention that X->rows, Y->columns, so they are
%   internally transposed to produced GX, GY.
%
% [GX, GY, ..., GN] = ELASTIX_BSPLINE_GRID(T)
% 
%   If T is an N-dimensional transform, the function produces the
%   corresponding N coordinates.
%
% You can visualize the control point grid using
%
%   plot(gx(:), gy(:), 'o')
%
% If you want to see the position of the image with respect to the control
% points:
%
%   hold on
%   box = [
%       t.Origin
%       t.Origin(1)+(t.Size(1)-1)*t.Spacing(1), t.Origin(2)
%       t.Origin+(t.Size-1).*t.Spacing
%       t.Origin(1), t.Origin(2)+(t.Size(2)-1)*t.Spacing(2)
%       t.Origin
%       ];
%   plot(box(:, 1), box(:, 2), 'r', 'LineWidth', 2)
