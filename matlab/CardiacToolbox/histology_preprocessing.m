function [imref, im, mask] = histology_preprocessing(imref, im)
% HISTOLOGY_PREPROCESSING  Prepare slices for intra-histology registration.
%
% HISTOLOGY_PREPROCESSING converts two histology images to grayscale,
% inverts and thresholds them (so that the background is black instead of
% white), extends the histograms to cover the dynamic range, and then
% matches the histograms. This prepares them to be registered.
%
% [IMREF2, IM2, MASK] = HISTOLOGY_PREPROCESSING(IMREF, IM)
%
%   IMREF, IM are two input histology images (in RGB colour or grayscale
%   format). The images can be provided as plain arrays (row, col,
%   channel), or as scimat format structs (see "help scimat" for details).
%   This function matches IM to IMREF.
%
%   IMREF2, IM2 are the output images after preprocessing.
%
%   MASK is a binary mask for IM2. This mask can be used to speed up
%   registration (when a mask is provided to elastix, only pixels within
%   the mask are used for the registration metric). The mask includes the
%   tissue and a bit of background around it.
