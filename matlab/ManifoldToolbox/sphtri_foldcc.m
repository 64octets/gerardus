% SPHTRI_FOLDCC  Find connected components of groups of vertices causing a
% fold on the sphere
%
% A triangle on the sphere is bad (flipped) if the volume of the
% tetrahedron it forms with the centre of the sphere is < 0. (In practice,
% it's useful to also consider very small positive triangles as bad, see
% VOLTRIMIN below).
%
% A vertex shared by at least one bad triangle is considered a bad vertex.
%
% Additionally, good vertices that are completely surrounded by bad
% vertices are also considered bad vertices. The reason is that a fold that
% folds again can produce good triangles, but in order to deal with the
% fold, all vertices need to be dealt with.
%
% [CC, vBadIdx] = SPHTRI_FOLDCC(TRI, X, VOLTRIMIN,  DCON, ISMANUALLYGOOD)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   VOLTRIMIN is the treshold for bad triangles. It can be a scalar or a
%   vector with one element per triangle in TRI. A triangle t is bad if the
%   volume of the tetrahedron formed by the triangle and the centre of the
%   sphere is < VOLTRIMIN. By default, VOLTRIMIN = 0.
%
%   DCON is the adjacency matrix of TRI. If it is not provided, it is
%   computed internally.
%
%   ISMANUALLYGOOD is a vector with vertices that the user wants to label
%   as "good" even if they are shared by any bad flipped triangles. By
%   default, ISMANUALLYGOOD=[] and is ignored.
%
%   CC is a cell vector. Each element contains a list of bad vertices
%   connected to each other.
%
%   vBadIdx are boolean indices of the bad vertices
