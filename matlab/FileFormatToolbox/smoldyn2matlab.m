function [ ] = smoldyn2matlab( n, voxel_size, actual_voxel_size)
%SMOLDYN2MATLAB imports and converts Smoldyn molecule trajectory into
%Matlab format.
%
%   The Smoldyn program (http://www.smoldyn.org/index.html) is used
%   to output trajectories of a large number of molecules. This data is
%   saved as text files, here assumed to be called trajs1.txt ...
%   trajsn.txt. This function converts this txt file to a matlab matrix
%   with the dimensions number of molecules x 3 x number of timesteps, wher
%   the 3 refers to the x,y and z co-ordinates of the molecules.
%   Matlab files are called positions1.mat ... positionsn.mat. The input n
%   is the number of files to be converted, assuming consecutive numbering
%   from 1 onwards. Note that the file size generated by Smoldyn can be
%   very large (many GBs), and if greater than approximately 6GB, Matlab
%   will fail to import the text file. To avoid this problem, create
%   multiple molecule types within Smoldyn and save the trajectories of
%   each as a separate txt file. Only those molecules which finish in the
%   voxel to be analysed are saved, which saves some space.
%
% SMOLDYN2MATLAB(N, voxel_size, actual_voxel_size)
%
% N is the number of trajectory files to be converted.
% voxel_size is the 1D length of the side of the volume simulated in um (assumed to be isotropic)
% actual_voxel_size is the 1D length of the side of the volume to be
% analysed (in um) (assumed to be isotropic)
