function h = nuimagesc(varargin)
% NUIMAGESC  imagesc() with non-uniform pixel spacing
%
% NUIMAGESC(X, Y, C) 
%
%   Diplays the C array as an image. C intensities will be scaled as in
%   IMAGESC().
%
%   X, Y are vectors with size(C, 2) and size(C, 1), respectively. X, Y
%   provide the axis values of the pixel centres. The vectors need to be
%   monotomic, but not uniform. The spacing between any consecutive pixels
%   needs to be a multiple of the smallest spacing.
%
%   When spacing is not uniform, X and Y will be extended at uniform
%   smallest spacing. Then, C will be linearly interpolated with INTERP2().
% 
% NUIMAGESC(X, Y, C, ...) 
%
%   The same extra arguments for IMAGE() can be passed to NUIMAGESC
%
% See also: interp2, imagesc, image.
